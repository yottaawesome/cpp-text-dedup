# cpp-text-dedup
The C++ version of my C# TextDedup utility.

## Why a second utility?
The portable release build of the C# .NET Core 2.1 version of TextDedup is a 60+MB monstrosity spread across a large number of files. I know we live in a world where software bloat is the norm, but I like to think I'm doing my part to fight it. :-)

## When will it be done?
ASAP. However, my availability will be limited over the next couple of months, so a delay is to be expected.
